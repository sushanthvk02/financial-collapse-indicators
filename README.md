# 🌍 Economic Collapse & Performance Prediction

This project investigates the economic performance and potential collapse risk of countries using financial, inflationary, and market indicators from 1990 to 2023. The primary goal is to model and understand what drives a country’s **economic strength**, using both regression and (eventually) classification techniques.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Predict a country's **economic_index** (0–100 scale) using key macroeconomic indicators.
- Identify the most influential predictors of economic stability and performance.
- Visualize trends, outliers, and relationships in macroeconomic data.
- Build interpretable models that can aid in early warning or policy evaluation.

## 🧠 Why This Project?

While GDP growth and inflation are often cited in isolation, real-world economic collapse tends to be driven by a complex mix of government debt, black market activity, interest rates, and inflation shocks. This project attempts to capture that complexity using a consolidated **economic_index** along with additional modeling layers.
